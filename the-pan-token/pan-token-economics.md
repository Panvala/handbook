# PAN Token Economics

Panvala’s matching funds don’t come from a foundation or wealthy benefactors. **Participating in Panvala allows communities to create their own matching funds.** Panvala’s economics are modeled on Bitcoin, which funds the network using inflationary block rewards. When you hold BTC, you’re opting into a system where you know your holdings will be diluted up to the maximum supply of 21 million BTC to fund block rewards for miners. Similarly, Panvala’s stakers have opted into a system where they will be diluted up to a maximum supply of 100 million PAN, and the Panvala League’s communities allocate that inflation themselves.

There are three portions of the token supply to keep in mind:

* The **circulating supply** consists of the tokens that have already been allocated \(46,913,127 PAN as of October 13\).
* The **decaying supply** consists of the tokens that are locked and released with a half-life of four years, the same half-life as Bitcoin uses \(43,086,872 PAN as of October 13\).
* The **reserved supply** consists of 10 million PAN that the token holders can allocate as needed. This is intended for exceptional opportunities to expand Panvala that cannot be achieved with the quarterly inflation. \(10,000,000 PAN as of October 13\)

A key difference from Bitcoin's model is that in Panvala, **all donations go back into the decaying supply**. That means the supply curve doesn't project the actual circulating supply in the future, it projects the _maximum_ supply. In reality, every donation reduces the actual circulating supply.

In the long run, the flow of donations puts downward pressure on the circulating supply that fluctuates based on economic conditions. The  model in the chart above reaches equilibrium at an annual budget around 1,000,000 PAN. At that point, there are no inflation subsidies available: for every token going into the token supply as a donation, there's one token coming out as inflation. This is similar to the end goal for the Bitcoin network to rely only on transaction fees instead of block rewards.

Over time, Panvala will approach its maximum supply, and the inflation subsidies will decrease. Our hypothesis is that we could have a decade or two of healthy inflation subsidies before they taper off. That’s why Panvala doesn’t just pursue inflation subsidies for communities: we pursue all possible subsidies for communities. As the inflation subsidies taper off, we aim to build up corporate sponsorships to keep funding flowing to Panvala League communities. That’s what makes Panvala the **sustainable** treasury for communities to share: our approach can keep subsidies flowing in perpetuity.
