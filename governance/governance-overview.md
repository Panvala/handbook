# Governance Overview

Governance in Panvala is focused on what happens _off-chain_ in stakeholder groups, not on on-chain voting. Our stakeholder groups work together to produce a single budget recommendation each quarter through the [Panvala Caucus](panvala-caucus.md), which includes allocations for the [Panvala League](panvala-league/) and the [Activities Fund](activities-fund.md).

PAN token holders have the final say each quarter. If no one disputes the recommendation that the Panvala Caucus has submitted for the quarter, then consensus has been reachedâ€”that recommendation executes without any vote required.

When there are disputes, any token holder can stake 50,000 PAN to submit their own recommendation. When two or more recommendations are submitted during a quarter, a vote is triggered in our smart contracts. The winning recommendation is executed, and the tokens staked on any losing recommendations are donated back to Panvala's token supply.
