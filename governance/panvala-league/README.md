# Panvala League

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Communities in the Panvala League stake PAN tokens to earn donation matching capacity from Panvala's inflation. The existing communities in the League have a strong influence over which communities to add to the League. In recent quarters, 75% of Panvala's quarterly inflation has been allocated to the Panvala League, which was able to [match donations for each community at an average of **10.26x** last quarter](https://forum.panvala.com/t/panvala-league-funding-recap-for-batch-eight-september-2020/229).

We want your community to join the Panvala League! Continue on to Expanding the League to learn more about how we grow.
