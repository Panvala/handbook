# Coalitions

Coalitions are sub-leagues within the Panvala League, just like divisions or conferences within sports leagues. The goal of a coalition is to grow its existing communities, and to add new communities within their focus. Since we want to encourage more close collaboration between Panvala League communities, communities that are part of a coalition will earn more matching than independent communities. If youâ€™re interested in helping more of a specific type of community earn donation matching from Panvala, you should start a coalition!
