# PAN Token Voting

In Panvala, we use on-chain voting to resolve disputes, not to make decisions. It's like a courthouse: you want it to be there if you need it, but it's better to avoid using it altogether. This is the approach that the whole DAO ecosystem seems to be converging to, led by [Snapshot and Aragon](https://aragon.org/blog/snapshot).

When disputes arise between multiple budget proposals on chain, a vote is triggered in the smart contracts. The voting window occurs during week 12 of Panvala's 13-week calendar. For next quarter, the voting window is January 15-22.
