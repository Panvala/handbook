# Panvala Caucus

By design, Panvala’s smart contracts only allow one budget proposal per quarter to pass, so the community has to form a group to discuss and reach consensus.

The Panvala Caucus is Panvala’s version of Ethereum’s Core Devs. Each quarter, the Caucus recommends a budget for approval. The network can accept those recommendations or challenge them, which initiates a token vote.

You can join the Caucus! All you need is PAN tokens and a willingness to cooperate to produce unified recommendations that move Panvala forward.
