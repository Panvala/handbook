# Panvala Fellows

Want to earn PAN by using your skills to help Panvala? Apply to become a Panvala Fellow! Fellows work on Panvala part-time by lending their skills wherever they think they can improve Panvala. The existing fellows evaluate prospective fellows, and collectively manage the [Fellows multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x47aE9FaF3AbeA7b2acAC69aB0A7B939201FeA5F6/transactions).

Ideal applicants are existing Panvala community members who have already contributed in some way to Panvala, and who are active in one of the Panvala League's communities.

Say hello in the \#future-fellows channel in Discord to get started.
