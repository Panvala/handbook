# Activities Fund

The Activities Fund is a member-run portion of Panvala's budget focused on social life. It awards grants for events, arts, and \(e-\)sports that bring people together across Panvala’s communities, especially members of the Activities Fund itself. It's modeled on university student governments that fund social life on campuses. These grants are usually used for prizes or food \(for in-person events\) to encourage higher attendance at events.

To choose which future events should receive funding, [join the Activities Fund on the Panvala Discord server](https://discord.gg/yZmYZbf)! The first set of signers for the Activities Fund multisig will be chosen by December 1 by each person on Discord who holds at least 100 PAN. Once we’ve chosen signers, the Activities Fund members will have through January 29 to which grants to award. PAN tokens will be released to the Activities Fund multisig from Panvala’s inflation on January 29.

## FAQ

### How is the Activities Fund different from the Panvala League?

Here are a few ways the Activities Fund differs from the Panvala League:

* **Member representation:** Communities in the League are governed in a variety of ways, but representatives govern the Activities Fund in the style of student governments. Once you become a member of the Activities Fund and complete any introductory requirements, you get to cast an equal vote the next time representatives are chosen.
* **Special purpose:** Communities in the League have a variety of goals, but the Activities Fund has a special purpose: bring people together across Panvala’s communities, especially members of the Activities Fund itself.
* **Participation and attendance goals:** Communities in the League maximize their funding by staking and donating, but the initial goal for the Activities Fund is to maximize participation and attendance for the events it funds.

### How are Activities Fund grants evaluated?

The Activities Fund's grants are evaluated on event attendance and participation. Unlike the Panvala League's funding that comes from donation matching, Activities Fund grants don't have any fundraising requirements. If people are showing up to your events, it's a success! Bonus points if the attendees are members of communities in the Panvala League, and even more bonus points if the attendees are members of the Activities Fund itself.

### Do I have to be a member of a Panvala League community to apply for Activities Fund grants?

No, anyone can apply for Activities Fund grants. Note that grants are evaluated based on attendance and participation. Events that draw more attendance from within the Panvala League and Activities Fund members will receive higher ratings, but attendance from outside Panvala counts, too.

### Can Panvala League communities apply for Activities Fund grants as well?

Yes! We encourage the Panvala League's communities to apply for Activities Fund grants for any events that are open to the public.
