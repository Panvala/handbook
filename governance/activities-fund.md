# Activities Fund

The Activities Fund is a member-run portion of Panvala's budget focused on events, arts, and \(e-\)sports that bring people together across Panvala’s communities, especially members of the Activities Fund itself.

Here are a few ways the Activities Fund differs from the Panvala League:

* **Member representation:** Communities in the League are governed in a variety of ways, but representatives govern the Activities Fund in the style of student governments. Once you become a member of the Activities Fund and complete any introductory requirements, you get to cast an equal vote the next time representatives are chosen.
* **Special purpose:** Communities in the League have a variety of goals, but the Activities Fund has a special purpose: bring people together across Panvala’s communities, especially members of the Activities Fund itself.
* **Participation and attendance goals:** Communities in the League maximize their funding by staking and donating, but the initial goal for the Activities Fund is to maximize participation and attendance for the events it funds.

To choose which future events should receive funding, [join the Activities Fund on the Panvala Discord server](https://discord.gg/yZmYZbf)! The first set of signers for the Activity Fund multisig will be chosen by December 1 by each person on Discord who holds at least 100 PAN. Once we’ve chosen signers, the Activity Fund members will have through January 29 to which grants to award. PAN tokens will be released to the Activity Fund multisig from Panvala’s inflation on January 29.
