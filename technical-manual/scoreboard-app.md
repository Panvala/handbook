# Scoreboard App

The Scoreboard app at [scoreboard.panvala.com](https://scoreboard.panvala.com/) is an interactive dashboard of metrics based on the [scoreboard spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1epswepiJTZF7NMtOfEAMcIviw5rXVYPm99hGUDhcnQs/edit#gid=2037752121) that the Panvala League has used in recent batches to allocate their budget. The codebase is in the [`scoreboard/`](https://github.com/Panvala/panvala/tree/master/scoreboard) directory of our repository.
