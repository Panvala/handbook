The Scoreboard App is an interactive dashboard of metrics based on the [scoreboard spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1epswepiJTZF7NMtOfEAMcIviw5rXVYPm99hGUDhcnQs/edit#gid=2037752121) that the Panvala League has used in recent batches to allocate their budget. As of this writing, the Scoreboard App is in its early stages of development.
