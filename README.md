Welcome to Panvala! **Panvala is the sustainable treasury for communities to share.** The share of PAN you hold is the share of Panvala's subsidies that your communities can enjoy in perpetuity. If BTC is digital gold and ETH is digital oil, **PAN is a digital endowment** for your community.

There are currently 47 communities in the Panvala League who allocate 75% of Panvala’s quarterly inflation using donation matching, with [7.5x matching last quarter.](https://forum.panvala.com/t/panvala-league-funding-recap-for-batch-nine-december-2020/241) We believe that Panvala’s treasury grows stronger the more we share it, so we aim to grow the Panvala League from sixteen communities to thousands.

We want you and your community to join Panvala! If you're already set on joining, head to [Join Panvala](https://handbook.panvala.com/join-panvala) to get started. If you want to learn more about the Panvala League in particular, you can [skip to that section of the handbook](https://handbook.panvala.com/governance/panvala-league). If you want to learn more about Panvala's mission, read the [Cultivating Civic Life in Cyberspace](https://handbook.panvala.com/essays/cultivating-civic-life-in-cyberspace) essay. Otherwise, the best way to use the handbook is to read pages in order—they're sorted in order of importance.
