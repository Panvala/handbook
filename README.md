# Getting Started

Welcome to Panvala! **Panvala is the sustainable treasury for communities to share.** There are currently ten communities in the Panvala League who allocate 75% of Panvala’s quarterly inflation using donation matching, with [10.26x matching last quarter.](https://forum.panvala.com/t/panvala-league-funding-recap-for-batch-eight-september-2020/229) We believe that Panvala’s treasury grows stronger the more we share it, so we aim to grow the Panvala League from ten communities to thousands.

We want you and your community to join Panvala! If you're already set on joining, head to [Join Panvala](join-panvala.md) to get started. If you want to learn more about the Panvala League in particular, you can [skip to that section of the handbook](governance/panvala-league/). If you want to learn more about Panvala's mission, read the [Cultivating Civic Life in Cyberspace](essays/cultivating-civic-life-in-cyberspace.md) essay. Otherwise, the best way to use the handbook is to read pages in order—they're sorted in order of importance.
